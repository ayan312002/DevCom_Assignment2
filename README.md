Some more feature/ui changes can be implemented like

2) a good intro section/ home page
3) a tab about the dev team
4) a widget tab on side to show recent activity
5) contact us page
6) View Articles By Author
7) Edit Profile 
8) More Flexibility in editor of article Content(It now supports HTML formatted content , preview button is coming soon)

Also i have to restructure the project into a better readable form.

Note:This project uses materialise CSS for design
And i have opted out of bootstrap since i didnt want to use too much of 3rd party library
